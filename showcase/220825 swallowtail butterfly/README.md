**Case cause:** To have fun drawing with 3D printing pen

**Type:** Artistic, decorative crafting

**Difficulty:** Easy. 

**Descriptions:** 3D printing pen and hot glue melt gun are two kinds of commonly seen "3D pens" that develop our creativity. The former use the same material (usually PLA filament) as FDM printers. There are plenty of interesting works on the Internet.
