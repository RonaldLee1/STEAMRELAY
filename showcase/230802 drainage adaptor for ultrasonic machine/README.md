**Case cause:** To facilitate the drainage of wastewater from an ultrasonic machine. That is, to make an adaptor from the drainage valve to the pipe. 

**Type:** General, functional object design

**Difficulty:** Easy. 

**Descriptions:** This is a typical plumber job. FDM is not the best option but still, it is very quick.

A professional plumber may be able to recognize the sizes of the parts by eyeballing. If you don't have that knowledge, a caliper or a ruler would help.

**Figure 2**  Overall view of adaptor design

Of course, there are free models of typical adaptors on the internet. Meanwhile drawing one would only cost 20 minutes thanks to the fast development of CAD software.

There are generally three parts of the adaptor: 
- a standard threaded part for the valve
- a hex nut for fastening, and
- a simple cylinder for the hose. 

By simply applying chamfer and fillets, the design can be smooth. 

Note that usually, the lower part (to the hose) does not need a larger diameter than the upper part (to the valve). In this case, we use a larger lower part simply because the hose was handy and we didn't need to source out another hose.

To have better adhesion when printing, we put it upside down to make the contact area larger. It only takes about 40 mins to print it out by VORON ZERO with 0.1 mm layer height. 

Note that the normal 0.2 mm layer height should work for most cases. We use higher precision because we can and also because it can improve the print quality of hanging perimeters. 

No post-process is needed in this case.

Thread seal tape was applied to the valve end. For the other end, just plug in. And done.

Also, there were other plumber adaptors made by FDM and successfully installed and worked well.
