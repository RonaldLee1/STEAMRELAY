This is not a real good idea. It's just an option when you don't have plumber tools. 

The objective is simple: the cut PVC pipe is not long enough to reach the U under a sink.

**Figure 1** About 210 mm longer PVC pipe needed as marked by red arrows

To extend the cut PVC, a simple hollow cylinder was drawn.

To make sure this extension pipe can connect with the cut edge without leaking, two "walls" were designed to hold the pipe tight (of course to ensure no leaking, thread seal tape or glue is recommended)

Note that it is not easy to print something tall and thin by FDM so be sure you try the best to get bed adhesion to prevent the model from falling during the print. If it does fall, don't throw it away, you can slice again and print the cylinder shell to the length you need and than use a soldering iron to connect your prints (i know, this looks stupid, but worked).

**Figure 4** Finished work and tested with zero leakage

And, this is actually not a very economic way to fix the problem since it would cost a long printing time and use long filament. Try the cheap filament for this.
