This is not a real good idea. It's just an option when you don't have plumber tools. 

The objective is simple: the cut PVC pipe is not long enough to reach the U under a sink.

To extend the cut PVC, a simple hollow cylinder was drawn.

To make sure this extension pipe can connect with the cut edge without leaking, two "walls" were designed to hold the pipe tight (of course to ensure no leaking, thread seal tape or glue is recommended)

Note that it is not easy to print something tall and thin by FDM so be sure you try the best to get bed adhesion to prevent the model from falling during the print. 

And this is actually not a very economic way to fix the problem since it would cost a long printing time and use long filament. Try the cheap filament for this.
