**Case cause:** Some data acquisition devices and DC power supplier needed to be installed outdoors and exposed to the weather including typhoons

**Type:** Specific, functional object design

**Difficulty:** Middle. It should be able to be waterproof. And UV resistance was needed. 

**Description:** 

The DAQ was provided by the requestor which needs data retrieval every month as well as battery check. The housing should also be able to easily open for sensor replacement for certain reasons every month. 

Considering the above demands, TPU housing was determined. The make is shown below:
