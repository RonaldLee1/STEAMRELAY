Cleaning up messy room and treasuring for reusable unsued are something i would do. And this time the below frame with casters was found

To make it reusable, maybe rust removal and painting works should be the first. But I started with covering the top with a unsed wood plate and protect the four extruding corners first.

This step is easy, just measure the dimensions, find the right wood plate, and cut it up with circular saw. 

Then for the four corners, some TPU parts were printed as thier caps.

One thing to mention that, if you want something like this printed successfully, better have thicker design for the top part of the model, because you will need enough layers to ensure the small bridging in the Slicer software. Yes, i made a mistake here. and wasted some time.
