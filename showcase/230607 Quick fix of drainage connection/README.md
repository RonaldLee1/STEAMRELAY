**Case cause:** The drainage of a sink was connected to a sediment tank to avoid cementitious waste water going into the drainage system directly. But when there were no cementitious works, we needed to empty the sediment tank to avoid stagnant water (mosquitos, you know). The problem was that the original design of the sink and tank didn't allow the normal non-cementitious waste water to go to the drain directly. Therefore a reroute/bypass was needed. 

**Type:** Specific, functional object design

**Difficulty:** Middle. 

**Description:** Plumber again. I decided to finish it in 2 hours including printing time. Thus the design was rough here and used TPU for extra flexibility:

The main idea here is to use steel wires to fasten the printed part to the fixed PVC outlet. That's why there are six holes left at the edge. Apply thread seal tape first as always.

Part B will cover the both inside and outside of the fixed PVC pipe to prevent leaking.

**Figure 3** Overall look


The connection between Part A to Part B was a hose. Simply plugged in after applying some sealing tape. Finally, used steel wire to fasten and shape the whole set. 


As a quick and temporary fix, this was not looking great after done, but the time was greatly saved. And after two months of use, it has been proven functional without a leak.
