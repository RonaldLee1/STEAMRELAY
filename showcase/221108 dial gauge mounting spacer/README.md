**Case cause:** The dial gauge on the Oedometer test device was to be upgraded to a digital one replacing the old manual one. But the new digital dial gauge has a smaller stem that cannot be grasped by the handle of the odometer machine. Thus, a spacer needs to be made to fit in the gap.

**Type:** Specific, functional object design

**Difficulty:** Easy. 

**Descriptions:** It is just a simple cylinder spacer. Printed in TPU but normally PLA PETG ABS would work the same.

A flange was added to prevent it from falling when loosening the clamp. 

Turned out it fitted perfectly and the problem was solved in only 30 minutes. Without FDM this case won't be so nicely done. I would probably try some tapes to fill that gap, which must be unreliable and ugly.
