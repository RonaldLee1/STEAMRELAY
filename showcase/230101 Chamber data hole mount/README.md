**Case cause:** A temperature and humidity chamber has a data hole for sensor cores, while we needed to use a USB hub to connect to the sensors inside the chamber. 

**Type:** Specific, functional object design

**Difficulty:** Easy. 

**Descriptions:**  One of the principles of STEAM RELAY service is to make things work quickly with minimum extra expense. In this case, we used an idle USB hub for the connection. 

In the very beginning, we used tapes and steel wires to temporarily mount the USB hub on the hole. It was not stable and umm ugly. The original data hole cover was made of metal and was not so well covered when data cores were through as shown below:

By removing the original hole cover we can measure the essential dimensions for the next step of CAD design.

The design was not complicated, just one hole cover and a tray to mount the USB hub. Ribs were added to make the tray stable.

And the printing was easy for those parts. Note that flexible material TPU (the white cylindrical part) was used for better sealing.

You can see that the sealing is better now and the appearance improves (well, the USB tags need to change to zip tie to look better...).
