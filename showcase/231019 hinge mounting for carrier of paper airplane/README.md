**Case cause:** For preparing an incoming activity engaging high school students to have fun and promote our Institute, we wanted to make hinge stands which mount the "aircraft carrier". 

**Type:** Specific, functional object design

**Difficulty:** Easy. 

**Description:** The off-the-shelf laser cut "aircraft carrier" looks like the below photo after assembly.

The goal is to make it fixed on the table and also have a hinge to adjust the ejection angle of the paper airplane. 

Our first thought was to drill some holes on the bottom wood of the carrier, then mount it onto a printed hinge stand. But somehow in this way screw nuts will be exposed (well, a bit not neat), so we tried the other way: to reverse engineer the bottom wood plate and print a substitute directly connect to the hinge beneath it.

To verify the scketch, a sample with only three layers (0.6 mm tall) was printed:

It actually fitted with some minor holes in the wrong place. 

Soon those the minor mistakes were fixed and the first prototye was out:

**Figure 4** First one

Unfortunately this time it didn't work as we thought. Seems like different printers have different tolerence which were big enough to make this failed. The difference seemed minor but could cost a lot of adjustment. So we actually abort this way and went back to the initial plan.

**Figure 5** Second one - worked

This time things were simplified and worked like charm.

**Figure 6** Installed

Note that the hinge will be installed on something solid with alignment of multiple carriers later on by using the M3 screws at the feet of this stand. 

Well, as mentioned, the exposed screw nuts were not so pretty... hope we could do better rev-eng next time XD.
