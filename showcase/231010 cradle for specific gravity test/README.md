**Case cause:** We would like to have a cheap and flexible plan for the specific gravity test of 100 mm diameter cylindrical bitumen specimen.  

**Type:** Specific, functional object design

**Difficulty:** Middle. 

**Description:** The first version was done a year ago as shown in the photo below.

It worked well but the design was a bit rough (i.e., ugly). 

So when it got rusty this year I decided to redo it with less steel but more water-resilient material like TPU. Meanwhile, I wanted to make the wiring a bit more elegant, like version 2 shown below:

There was only one continuous TPU filament going through all the connection points. Looked smart but sadly doesn't work at all since I can never adjust the length to a functional degree. 

Then I cut off the filament into 4 and made the below version 3:

In this version heat inserts and screws were adopted and mostly well hidden in order to make it a clean and neat appearance. 0.8 mm diameter TPU was made by re-extruding the original 1.75 mm from a printer. All seemed brilliant for a slim moment, and then, after making it real, soon I found a fatal issue: it always flipped over no matter how you put a "babe" into this cradle. 

I still cannot figure it out how to make it stable in a decent way. So finally I gave up and made the below version 4 using steel wires again...

Though in this case failures were frustrating but I'd like to point out those trials made me understand a bit more about applying different materials working together. And the tricks about connection.
