**Case cause:** For one urgent demonstrative electricity generator project, a stand with hinge and housing was needed. 

**Type:** Specific, functional object design

**Difficulty:** Middle. 

**Description:** The main parts of this case were the mount and housing for the motor, a hinge to make the motor rotatable and fixed as needed. And a stand below all these. 

For this kind of case, if no dimensions are given, a bit measurement is a must:

At this point additional requirement came up, that the hinge needs to be rotatable 90 degrees. therefore the stem was elongated.

Note that frequent confirmation with the requestor about the design details is essential every step of the way.

The feature of this case is quick. My experience is that the more urgent a case is, the more communication and double, triple checks are needed.
