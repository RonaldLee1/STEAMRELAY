**Case cause:** To make street snaps using DSLR more convenient, easier, and better view finding. 

**Type:** Specific, functional object FDM design

**Difficulty:** Middle

**Descriptions:** This case shows the capability of FDM to fulfill the very obscure but sincere needs of the minority. It is pretty limited to people who use DSLR doing street shots. For more details please find the link below. 

In nature, it is using a red dot sight as an additional viewfinder. This design achieved: 
- Minimized parallax error by getting the axis of red dot sight as close to that of the lens.
- Maximized view-finding range by using red dot sight
- Still, the red dot sight has an excellent feature in that it can make your aiming accurate even when you are moving. After all, it was invented for guns.

The difficulty of this case is that all dimensions have to be determined precisely while the stiffness of the ring must be just enough to avoid extra weight. 

There are no better ideas or products for this specific goal as far as I know. I am happy to make it. 

The model was uploaded to https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/tool/red-dot-sight-finder-mount-adaptor-ring-for-canon-100-mm-macro for more people who like it. Well, it is not popular as expected. But I'd say it is a pretty idea and well-realized.
