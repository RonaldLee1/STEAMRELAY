**Case cause:** An erosion-related project requires putting steel specimens outdoors exposed to the weather and should survive the typhoons during the coming years. 

**Type:** Specific, functional object FDM design

**Difficulty:** Middle. The loading must be considered well since typhoons can be pretty destructive in Hong Kong. And this case requires multiple materials including a PMMA plate, glue tapes, screws, etc.

**Descriptions:** ABS will be the best choice. But PLA+ was used for the main body since by that time we don't have an enclosed machine for ABS printing. The target is a steel specimen that needed to be fully exposed to nature, there for the best way to mount it is using strong double side tape to a very smooth body - PMMA plate was chosen, as a "transitional object" linking the specimen to the main body of mounting.

This is a typical tailor-made case. Without FDM, woodworking would be accessible but need an additional protective finish/coating. Metal (aluminum) mounting would be more expensive and will need CNC machines which we don't have.

Later on, three more were made as shown below. To save some screws and nuts we used steel wires to do the fixing.
