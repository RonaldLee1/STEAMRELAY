**Case cause:** An erosion-related project requires putting steel specimens outdoors exposed to the weather and should survive the typhoons during the coming years. 

**Type:** Specific, functional object FDM design

**Difficulty:** Middle. The loading must be considered well since typhoons can be pretty destructive in Hong Kong. And this case requires multiple materials including PMMA plate, glue tape, screws, etc.

**Descriptions:** ABS will be the best choice. But PLA+ was used for the main body since by that time we don't have an enclosed machine for ABS printing. The target is a steel specimen that needed to be fully exposed to nature, there for the best way to mount it is using strong double side tape to a very smooth body - PMMA plate was chosen, as a "transitional object" linking the specimen to the main body of mounting.

This is a typical tailor-made case. Without FDM, woodworking would be accessible but need an additional protective finish/coating. Metal (aluminum) mounting would be more expensive and will need CNC machines which we don't have.
