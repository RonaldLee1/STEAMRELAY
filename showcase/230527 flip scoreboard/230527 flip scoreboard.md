**Case cause:** To hold a taster programme involving competitive game playing, a scoreboard is needed. 

**Type:** General, functional object FDM design

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Descriptions:** A flip scoreboard serves a simple function and is constructed by a simple stand and the number plates from 0 to 9. At that time no ideal model was found online while buying one had other problems (e.g., paperwork, style, etc.). Considering designing one only cost 30 minutes tops, why not just do it by self and happy printing.

Since we want the size of the scoreboard a bit large, it did cost some time to print all the nameplates. But overall it turned out a good choice. 

Then the model was uploaded to https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/flip-scoreboard for more people who like it. Turned out it's more popular than expected.
