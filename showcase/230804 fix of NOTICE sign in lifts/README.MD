**Case cause:** Some of the aluminum NOTICE letters were missing in the lifts. 

**Type:** General, functional object design

**Difficulty:** Easy. 

**Descriptions:** By looking into why the aluminum letter dropped off from the wall in the lifts, we found that the coarse surface of the alternating marble stripes should be the main reason. Sure that this could be fixed by putting up new aluminum letters, printed ones avoid paperwork. That's why.

**Figure 2**  CAD up

There is no difficulty to do the CAD part, while a small trick would save time here:

**Figure 3**  Adding connection to make the mesh in one piece

Add a plate to connect all the separated letters can make them in one piece. By doing this, one single STL file is generated but not six, so that you can save some tedious repeating steps.

**Figure 4**  Cut connection in slicer software

In the Silcer software (i.e., PrusaSlicer here), use the cut function to remove the temporary plate.

**Figure 5**  Post process

In this case, the printing is very easy. While we need to use some double side tapes attached to the print.

**Figure 6**  Done

Using FDM print to do this does not have much advantage. The good is that if it ever falls and gets missing again, we can make it up soon.

A bit hot working in the lifts.
