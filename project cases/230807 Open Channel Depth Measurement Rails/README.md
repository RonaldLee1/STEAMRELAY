**Case cause:** The lab was building an open channel and needed to DIY x y rails to measure water head (depth measurement) at different points.

**Type:** Project

**Difficulty:** Hard. The budget was limited while the span of the rail is large (2000 mm long x 500 wide) but the requirement of accuracy and precision were high. 

**Description:** 

The project is still ongoing and halfway through at the moment. 

Considering the long span (2000x500 mm), 2020 v-slot aluminum extrusions were adopted with rollers to save expenses.

So far this design looks robust and feasible. Another feature of STEAM RELAY is low cost...
