**Case cause:** The lab was building an open channel and needed to DIY x y rails to measure water head (depth measurement) at different points.

**Type:** Project

**Difficulty:** Hard. The budget was limited while the span of the rail is large (2000 mm long x 500 wide) but the requirement of accuracy and precision were high. 

**Description:** 

The project is basically done at the moment. All that needs is detailed calibration which will be done after the other part of the open channel is finished. 

Considering the long span (2000x500 mm), 2020 v-slot aluminum extrusions were adopted with rollers to save expenses.

This design is robust. The stiffness is proven quite enough. And the x carriage is capable of doing very fine calibration to make sure the depth caliper can read the correct results.

By the way, another feature of STEAM RELAY is low cost...
