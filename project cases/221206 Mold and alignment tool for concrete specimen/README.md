**Case cause:** A project needed to make special concrete specimens having embedded bolt and pre-drilled hole

**Type:** Project

**Difficulty:** Hard. It was heavy for making 150x150 mm standard concrete cubes. Involving fresh concrete casting made it a bit harder. 

**Description:** 

To be short, the CAD design looks like this:

There were several revisions to the design to make it more robust.
